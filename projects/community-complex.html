        <h1>Game Play</h1>
        <p>
            The community complex is a 2D puzzel game. 
            In this game your goal is to give every one a plac they can call home.
            The catch is that every has different preferences and needs. 
            For example Miep is a what older grandma so she would like to live on the first floor.
            Use your social skills to figure out what is the best place for everyone and try to keep everyone as happy as possible.

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        In this project I researched the concept of connection. 
        More specifically, the idea that everything is connected to each other.
        This interest was created when I was at a big concert on the 4th of May.
        Meaning that before the concert there was the 2 minutes of silence.
        Seeing how more than 500 people in a room could all collectively be silent 
        and show respect to everyone who died in World War II really made a big impact on me.
        I wanted to capture this feeling of connection in my game.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started of researching 'Six Degrees of Separation'. 
        This theory states that every person is connected to another person through six or fewer intermediaries.
        From this theory I started looking at other games for reference. Here I looked at
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.falloutshelter" target="_blank">Fallout shelter</a> and
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3431040/Thats_not_my_Neighbor" target="_blank">That's not my neighbor</a> as a references. 
        This is when I got the idea of making the Community Complex. 
        Where you have to look at applications like "that's not my neighbor" to give everyone a home they're happy with.

            <h1>Work flow</h1>
            <p>
                I started of this project my making a UML of how the full code structure would look like.
                In here I wrote out the full character class where I can save and calculate the different satisfactions.
                Then I made a simple apartment and request form class that use 
                the character class to get information like there name or age for example.
                In practice I had to make a lot more classes but this was a good start point to work with.

                I also focused a lot on game design this project instead of just coding.
