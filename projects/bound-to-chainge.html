    <h1>Game Play</h1>
    <p>
        Bound to chainge is a 2D platformer where you are trying to escape a prison.
        In the game you can make the player move around and jump.
        The catch is that there is a heavy metal ball attached to you.
        So you also need to cary or use the metal ball to be able to escape.

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        In this project I researched an all or nothing moment.
        Meaning that you have only one shot at trying to succeed at something.
        This is a feeling that I get a lot while playing Volleyball.
        So my goal while making this game was to give the player the same all or nothing feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        After looking at some reference materials I eventually found rage games. 
        Think about games like: Getting over it or Jump king. 
        Here the player also feels an immense amount of pressure to succeed at a jump for example. 
        This is what originally inspired most mechanics in bound to chainge.

    <h1>Work flow</h1>
    <p>
        In this project I made my own statemachine. With this I made 10 diffrent states the player could be in:

    <div class="row m-2">
        <ul class="col">
            <li>Climbing</li>
            <li>Crouching</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="col">
            <li>Falling</li>
            <li>Hanging</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="col">
            <li>Idle</li>
            <li>Jumping</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="col">
            <li>Pulling</li>
            <li>Rising</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="col">
            <li>Throwing</li>
            <li>Walking</li>
        </ul>
