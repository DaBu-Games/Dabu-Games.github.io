        <h1>Game Play</h1>
        <p>
            Bound to chainge is a 2D platformer where you are trying to escape a prison.
            In the game you can make the player move around and jump.
            The catch is that there is a heavy metal ball attached to you.
            So you also need to cary or use the metal ball to be able to escape.

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        In this project I researched an all or nothing moment.
        Meaning that you have only one shot at trying to succeed at something.
        This is a feeling that I get a lot while playing Volleyball.
        So my goal while making this game was to give the player the same all or nothing feeling.
        <br> <br>
        After looking at some reference materials I eventually found rage games.
        Think about games like: 
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" target="_blank">Getting over it</a>  
        or 
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/" target="_blank">Jump king</a>.
        Here the player also feels an immense amount of pressure to succeed at a jump for example.
        This is what originally inspired most mechanics in bound to chainge.

            In this project I made my own <a href="https://github.com/DaBu-Games/bound-to-chains/tree/main/bound-to-chains/Assets/Scripts/StateMachine" target="_blank">state machine</a>. 
            With this I made 10 different states the player could be in:

            I used this state machine to transition from different animations or change physics values of the player.
            For example if the player is in the falling state increase the gravity so you have more control over the jump.
