        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <p>
            Bound to chainge is a 2D platformer where you are trying to escape a prison.
            In the game you can make the player move around and jump.
            The catch is that there is a heavy metal ball attached to you.
            So you also need to cary or use the metal ball to be able to escape.

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        In this project I researched an all or nothing moment.
        Meaning that you have only one shot at trying to succeed at something.
        This is a feeling that I get a lot while playing Volleyball.
        So my goal while making this game was to give the player the same all or nothing feeling.
        <br> <br>
        After looking at some reference materials I eventually found rage games.
        Think about games like: 
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/" target="_blank">Getting over it</a>  
        or 
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/" target="_blank">Jump king</a>.
        Here the player also feels an immense amount of pressure to succeed at a jump for example.
        This is what originally inspired most mechanics in bound to chainge.

                    In this project I made my own state machine that I use for the player.
                    Here I can set different transition for every state I have in the state machine.
                    Every state uses the state base class. This class has an Enter,Exit, Update and fixed update function.

            <div class="col-md col-12">
                <p>
                    Now every update or fixed update you call the update/fixed update of the current state if it's not empty.
                    If the state is empty ignore it.
                </p>

                    You can call the Switch State in the state machine to switch to a different state.
                    In here you call the exit function of the old state and set the current state to the new state.
                    Then you call the enter function of the current state.
